----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the code source of a set of presentation I did in 2010
and 2011 in France, Luxembourg and Switzerland to present Play! Framework.
The code source shows various use case with HTML5, CSS3 and of
course Play! Framework features.

---------------------------------------
It requires Play! Framework v1.1.1
---------------------------------------
Please note that it was not tested with v1.2.x or older
version of Play! Framework

The code source licence is GPLv2.
